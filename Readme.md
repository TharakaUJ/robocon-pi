## Setup Instructions

Before running any ROS 2 nodes, **you must source the ROS 2 environment and set up the workspace folder**.  
Alternatively, you can simply run:

```bash
source setup.bash
```

This script will handle both the ROS 2 environment and folder setup for you.

## Firmware

All ESP32 firmware sketches are located in the `arduino` folder.

## Device Port Mappings

Port mappings for each device are specified in the `devices.yml` file.
